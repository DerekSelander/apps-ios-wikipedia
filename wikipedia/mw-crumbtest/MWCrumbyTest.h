This object makes it easier to automate higher-level testing of more complex async 
code (dependent NSOperations presently). Think unit testing but for things which 
are not so easily reduced to nice little units. Unity testing? This approach 
employs a "bread crumb" metaphor to define an execution "trail" which is then 
verified.

Needed a simple way to confirm that async operation(s) for a given task had executed in a 
pre-determined order. Tell this object's init what testing method to execute to set the 
test in motion. Then within the callbacks of the various async things that kicked off,
drop "crumbs". Init is also told what trail (of crumbs) it should expect and the order of
this expected trail is then verified by this button object as these crumbs are dropped as 
the execution progresses.
